# What to know

## Operating system keywords:

### Kernel

Kernel is a computer program in the centre of the operating system and it is what has complete control over everything and it controls all of the hardware devices.

### Booting 

Booting is a process where a computer is loading an operating system into its (RAM). After it has booted thats when the desktop screen will appear. 

### Executing 

The key word executing is where a system is starting to run a computer program. The process of this starts off with the source code being sent to the processor, it then gets converted into assembly code by the complier and after that the assembly code gets converted into object code by the assembler. 

### Interrupt

An interrupt is an event within the processor that will alter the its sequence of executing anything like programs or instructions. Interrupts can either be planned by the processor or they can be caused unexpectedly by an event that is not related to the currently running program.

### Scheduling and Multi-tasking

This is an extension to a system which performs multiprogramming and it is responsible for enabling the multiprogramming system to execute multiple programs at the same time. Therefore, the operating system is able to keep track of where the user is in these multiple tasks without losing any important information.

### File systems

File systems are a structure of data that is responsible for the storage of data and information on any storage devices connected to the computer. It is made to be easy to navigate through so that everything is easy to find.

### Input and output handling

Input and output handling is the concept of data entering the computer to be processed by the processor to be converted into output data to give the user a response. buffering caching and sporing.

### Memory management

This is the concept where all programs are run through the computers memory and it is used to allocate memory from secondary devices to prevent crashes.

### User mode 

User mode is the other mode that is next to kernel mode and which one is being used depends on what type of code is running on the processor. The user mode is used to run applications where kernel mode is used for running core operating system components.
